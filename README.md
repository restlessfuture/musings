The future is RESTLess.

Why do apps and front ends use REST over HTTP, an not more capable, more efficient protocols like MQTT?

Why do API standards use HTTP Verbs to determine the method? Why not stick to the payload for the Verb, or to the URL, rather than jumping to the header? Wouldn't POSTFull APIs be simpler?

Why not thinks asynchronous for everything first, and synchronous being a special case?

This is a space for thikning differently today, and it might be the norm of the future - the future is RESTLess!
